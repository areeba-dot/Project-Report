# Project-Report
My project was focused on simulation and measurement of millivolts level noise in the biasing supplies of a detector. I started with reading datasheet of TID-01583 which is a power supply reference design by Texas Instruments.The document contains TIs reference design for ultra-low noise programmable bias voltages and power supplies for thermal image sensors, utilizing the DAC80508, OPA2192, and TPS717 series components.After going through the document i moved onto the simulation of one of the biasing supplies filter circuit for it's noise analysis. The observations from that noise analysis included: There are 3 supplies being input to the detector each having a low pass filter at the backend. For it's realisation i injected few millivolts of white noise into the filter circuit along with the dc voltage. The dc voltage was set at 5V as the detetctor's dynamic range is 1-4.2V.Because of dc voltage, almost all of the input voltage portion was received on the output. The white noise injected in the start was of 1 millivolt and total noise present in output of the circuit was observed to be approximately 12.5 nano observed over a frequency of upto 10KHz.     
                                             After these biasing supplies are input to detector,a video signal is recieved from detector as an output.
